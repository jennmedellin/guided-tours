## Create a personal lab

As users must have a safe, regulated workspace, it is highly recommended to first create a personal or group lab when working with Vantage.

> To create a lab you must already belong to a "lab group" to have proper permissions. Contact your administrator for your company's policies.

### Create lab

In the editor, invoke lab creation by clicking on the add (+) button above the objects.

### Lab properies

Assume you already belong to a lab group, the following options are available:

- Lab name: a database name for this lab
- Lab size: a max size for your lab (thresholds set by admins)

### Copy tables into labs

The most common use case of labs is to copy existing tables or views. Click the overflow action (...) menu next to tables to begin copying. You must have READ persmissions to COPY a table.

Configure copy options and select which lab you'd like to copy this table into.

Now that you've successfully copied the table into your lab you can easily find it in your database object tree to begin working with it.
